# Launcher of the map library (track LIB of Grim World). Reference: scripts/agent.sh of
# bal7hazar/grimworld at 44586e6, which this copy matches line for line except for the
# differences marked `hexmap:` below: the unit prefix; --with-sepolia refused (the library's
# agents never deploy); --with-assets refused (no assets submodule here). A change of the
# shared code is made in the reference first. Original header:
# Grim World launcher: start or resume a sub-agent in its task worktree. claude agents run as
# transient systemd user units, outside the process tree and the cgroup of the calling session
# (a restart of the desktop app must not kill them); codex auditors are always detached with setsid (see the note at
# the launch below). Ported from the owner's glam-cairo launcher, with one deliberate
# difference: agents never run with --dangerously-skip-permissions. Each launch uses a committed profile
# (scripts/profiles/<profile>.txt) that becomes
# `--permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools … --disallowedTools …`; codex always runs in its
# read-only sandbox (codex audits, it never implements). See OPERATIONS.md §4 and
# docs/briefs/COMMON.md.
#
# usage:
#   scripts/agent.sh [options] <task> <claude|codex> <model> <new|resume> "<prompt>" [profile] [sid] [effort]
#   scripts/agent.sh status              one line per known task
#   scripts/agent.sh wait <task>         block until the agent of <task> has exited
#   scripts/agent.sh sid <task>          codex session id of <task> (for `resume`)
#   scripts/agent.sh model <task>        the model that actually ran, as the CLI recorded it
#   scripts/agent.sh thresholds          may an agent start now? (load and memory; exit 4 if not)
# options:
#   --dry-run            print what would be launched, launch nothing, need no worktree
#   --with-assets        hexmap: refused in this repository, it has no assets submodule
#   --with-sepolia       hexmap: refused in this repository, the library's agents never deploy;
#                        the Sepolia account variables are emptied in every agent
#   --branch <name>      create the worktree from origin/main on branch <name> if it is missing
# arguments:
#   model     claude: sonnet (Sonnet 5.5) | opus | fable or their full ids (claude-sonnet-5 only to
#             resume an agent started on it); codex: gpt-6-astra | gpt-6-sol | gpt-6-luna
#   profile   research | implement | audit (default: research for claude new, audit for codex;
#             on resume, the profile the task was launched with)
#   sid       codex session id, for `codex … resume` (see `sid`); ignored by claude
#   effort    reasoning effort (codex default: high; claude: the model's default)
# files, under <main checkout>/.claude/worktrees/:
#   cli-<task>/            the task worktree
#   logs/<task>.log        the agent's output; each run ends with a line `exit=<status> <date>`
#   logs/<task>.unit       the systemd unit (or <task>.pid when detached with setsid)
#   logs/<task>.profile    the profile of the launch, reused by `resume`
#   logs/<task>.cli        the CLI and the model id asked for, checked against the one that ran
#   logs/<task>.sepolia    present while the last launch had --with-sepolia (the brief grants it)
#   logs/<task>.last.md    codex only: its last message, i.e. the audit report

# codex never runs as a unit: its read-only sandbox (bubblewrap) needs an unprivileged user
# namespace, which this kernel refuses to systemd user units (apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns)
# and allows to the desktop app's own processes. codex is therefore detached with setsid from the
# calling session and keeps its sandbox; a restart of the desktop app kills it, and it is then
# resumed (`codex exec resume`). An agent without sandbox is never the answer.
