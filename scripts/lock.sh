# Build lock of the map library (copied from bal7hazar/grimworld, scripts/lock.sh at 6c2351e; only the lock name differs). The VPS (8 vCPU, 31 GB) is shared with the owner's other programmes:
# two concurrent Cairo test builds can be OOM-killed, and a sustained 100 % CPU makes the
# hypervisor throttle the machine. Two locks, always taken in this order:
#   * the PROJECT lock ($HEXMAP_BUILD_LOCK, default /tmp/hexmap-build.lock): at most one
#     heavy command of this project at a time, whichever agent runs it;
#   * the machine-wide HEAVY lock ($HEAVY_BUILD_LOCK, default ~/orchestrator/heavy-build.lock),
#     shared with every other programme. `scarb` and `snforge` on PATH are the machine's shims
#     (~/.local/bin), which take it by themselves; this script takes it for `--heavy` and for the
#     `sozo` commands that compile, since sozo does not go through those shims.
# Nested calls inherit the locks already held and take only the ones they miss, in the same
# order. Commands run under `nice -n 10` with capped parallelism.
#
# Only build and test commands are wrapped: the audit profile allows `scripts/lock.sh …`, so
# this script must not become a way to run anything else.
#
